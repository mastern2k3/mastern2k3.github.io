<div class=post-content><p>I figured it&rsquo;s time to start recording what I&rsquo;m up to with <strong>Throne of
Mithrill</strong>, so, here it goes.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=idle.gif alt="ToM basics">
</p>
<p>Although C# has been giving me a lot of trouble I&rsquo;ve managed to design things
stable enough to start putting in some of the basic mechanics, although I might need to port
everything to either Rust or Go.</p>
<p>First were the movement and engagement &ldquo;orders&rdquo; (as they once were called) got
implemented.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=move_attack.gif alt="Move and attack order">
</p>
<p>Then, the server and aggression system, allowing enemy mobs to strike back when a player entered proximity.<br>
If you&rsquo;re observant enough you&rsquo;ll notice the exclamation effect over the enemy
knight guy&rsquo;s head as he approaches the player and a focusing circle on the
triggering player.</p>
<p>The exclamation mark came in as an indication I put in to test the message was
being processed correctly, I added the rotating circle later to emphasize and
alarm the player.</p>
<p>It was important for me that the game would be built designed around the
multiplayer experience, so, synchronization and match authorization came almost
immediately.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=multiplayer.gif alt="Multiplayer and ownership">
</p>
<p>Since at this point the characters' ownership is given semi-randomly by the server, I found it helpful to add <strong>ownership indicators</strong>, however crude.</p>
<p>You can also notice the movement, auto-attack and auto-heal command interface.<br>
The like will snap and change colors according to the default offensive /
supportive ability of a character (in case they have one) or blue for simple
movement.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=aoe.gif alt="AOE abilities">
</p>
<p>Aside from the default offensive / supportive auto-abilities (which could later be selected by the player), characters can also use actionable abilities.<br>
I started with a simple circular AOE as a proof of concept but more will come.</p>
<p>A casting system is also in place, enforcing a vulnerability when casting.</p>
<h2 id=more-things-in-the-works>More things in the works<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#more-things-in-the-works>#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Aggro system</strong> - Although it&rsquo;s hard to notice there is an aggro system I&rsquo;m
work-shopping.<br>
Damage afflictions and heals cause enemies to redirect their
attention. It is very sensitive at the moment, causing redirections too often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Looting system</strong> - You might have noticed enemies dropping coins when they die
or the coins in the middle of the screen, those are collectible and a recent
refactoring caused the characters to stop collecting them.
Later enemies will drop other kinds of loot and one-time usables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enemy playbooks</strong> - When engaged, enemies execute a &ldquo;playbook&rdquo; -
a highly customizable and pluggable state machine.<br>
Currently said state machines are very simple, enemies start auto-attacking
their aggressor and use an ability periodically, but, soon I want to add enemy
healers which will put my design to the test.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=trajectory>Trajectory<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#trajectory>#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Platforms</strong> - I still have a lot to figure out regarding <strong>Godot</strong>. C# has
been giving me trouble, so I&rsquo;m looking into utilizing the GDNative bindings with
either Go or Rust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Complex playbooks</strong> - Enemies are not really threatening at the moment, so I
want to introduce a support-type enemy and an enrage mechanic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buff system</strong> - As part of introducing an enrage mechanic I&rsquo;ll be adding a
basic buff system, allowing me to apply effects for variable periods of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bosses</strong> - Once the buff system and new playbooks are in place I&rsquo;ll start
experimenting with more complex maps and bosses.</p>
<p>I am set to build a team-oriented game and I want bosses to play an important
role, soon I&rsquo;ll be posting some drafts for the first boss encounter.</p>
