<div class=post-content><p>As discussed in the <a href=https://gatomalo.dev/blog/2019/09/10/my-items-bring-all-the-boys-to-the-yard/>previous post</a>, the subject of this latest version is
improving controls.</p>
<h3 id=player-selection>Player selection<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#player-selection>#</a></h3>
<p>Clicking or dragging a player character now causes selection, meaning their
skill bar will appear.</p>
<p>In addition, many players tried right-clicking the ground as a means of
commanding a move, just as expected in almost every RTS, so I also added a
much expected right-click move command.</p>

<h3 id=ability-range-indication>Ability range indication<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ability-range-indication>#</a></h3>
<p>Trying to use a range limited ability now shows the player&rsquo;s required proximity.</p>
<p>Issuing an out-of-range action will result in the character first, reaching
required proximity, and only then, executing the cast.</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=out_of_range.gif alt="Out of range commands">
</p>
<h3 id=auto-panning>Auto panning<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#auto-panning>#</a></h3>
<p>Although simple and not entirely tested, I&rsquo;ve added automatic panning so the
camera follows the average point between all player characters.</p>
<p>I feel it is a net positive that needs further tweaks, that&rsquo;s overall better
than the manual way. It still leaves an unsolved problem of sometimes requiring
a manual way of controlling the viewport, but, I guess that&rsquo;ll have to be fixed
later when I have more feedback and better solutions.</p>
<h2 id=the-book-of-kek-was-acquired>The &ldquo;Book of Kek&rdquo; was acquired!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-book-of-kek-was-acquired>#</a></h2>
<p>As introduced in the last version, enemies now drop items.
And I am proud to announce that the rarest, among the ones released, has been
acquired, courtesy of <strong>Taiwan!</strong></p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=taiwan_book_of_kek.png alt="Taiwan gets Book of Kek">
</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t intend on this item being a rarity, but, since most testers don&rsquo;t manage
past the first group of enemies, reaching the <strong>&ldquo;Old Yeller&rdquo;</strong> and getting the
book was a happy moment for me.</p>
<p>This accomplishment as well as all recently played matches and their results are
available for browsing on the <a href=https://gatomalo.dev/throne/results/>match board</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully this new version will get new player past the hump of needing to pan
the viewport.</p>
<h2 id=coming-next-balancing-survival-mode>Coming Next, Balancing, Survival Mode<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#coming-next-balancing-survival-mode>#</a></h2>
<p>Now that the major control issues are addressed I can showcase the game to
less forgiving players (without them tripping on the minor control problems).</p>
<p>So, unless some major issues arise from feedback, I&rsquo;ll be focusing on gameplay.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Balancing</strong> - Although I&rsquo;m still unsure how to approach it, the skills and
open variables in the game are still unbalanced. A great example of this is
the fireball skill of the wizard, easily taking down enemies from afar without
risking too much.</p>
<p>Hopefully implementing a survival mode will make it easier to prototype
balancing those variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Survival Mode</strong> - As mentioned in the last post, and for the sake of more
easily testing and balancing gameplay, I&rsquo;ll be implementing a survival type
map where waves of enemies approach the characters in the middle, with the end
goal of surviving as long as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned before, I would gladly appreciate any kind of feedback, either here
or on <a href=https://mastern2k3.itch.io/tom>itch.io</a>.</p>
