Hi! I'm Nitzan :wave:

I've been in front of computer screens ever since I can remember myself.

Meeting with my friends just to sit together in the study and watch them play
**StarCraft**.

I got into programming rather early, during 4th grade my mom signed me up for an
after school class labeled *"come build computer games with VisualBasic 6!"*, **a
blatant lie**, but nonetheless, I learned to program and got hooked.

It's become exponentially worse since then, to the point where I have a
[program](https://github.com/mastern2k3/html-resume) generate my CV out of a
configuration file.

### Game development

Although I've always been interested in game development, experimenting with
engines and building nonsense games, I owe my newfound passion of game dev to my
friends - my **nakamas**.

Two years ago, me and my friends got committed in becoming a successful game
studio.

It started with a weekly meetup where we'd discuss technology, workshop game
ideas and prototype them, and slowly became a hardened supportive team aimed at
becoming world renowned.

This blog is an attempt at documenting my private endeavors and team efforts in
the adventure of building awesome games.

The cat's name is Sumsum and he's going through a phase.
