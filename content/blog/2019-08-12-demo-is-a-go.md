At last I've managed to stabilize the client and make it playable.

I ended up adding a lot of new stuff on the server side as well - match
recording, an API and a webpage to show off match results.

After downloading and playing the demo you can see your match results in the
listing displayed below and in the dedicated page [here]({{< ref "/throne/results.md" >}}).

This is a very early take on the concept and is offered here as nothing more
than a way to get early feedback from testers and curious gamers about controls,
mechanics and the overall concept of a tactics rpg.

I would gladly appreciate any kind of feedback, either here or on [itch.io](https://mastern2k3.itch.io/tom).
